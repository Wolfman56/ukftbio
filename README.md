# Universal Knowledge Field Theory (UKFT) Biology: Noospheric Synthesis

**Biological complexity as an emergent property of collective choice.**

This repository extends the principles of **UKFT (Universal Knowledge Field Theory)** into the domain of biology, specifically focusing on protein folding, molecular synthesis, and evolutionary dynamics as expressions of "Choice-Guided" self-organization.

## Theoretical Basis

Just as `ukftphys` demonstrated that physical laws (Standard Model, Gravity) emerge from entropic choice minimization, `ukftbio` explores:
1.  **Protein Folding as Choice**: The "Levinthal Paradox" is resolved not by random search, but by an "Entropic Attractor" in the choice space of amino acid configurations.
2.  **Molecular Synthesis as Language**: Chemical reactions are treated as semantic operations in a "Molecular Syntax," guided by high-level teleological goals (Theosphere).
3.  **Noospheric Evolution**: Evolution is not merely random mutation + selection; it is a "conscious" search process where the environment (Context) and the organism (Agent) co-create the fitness landscape.

### Key Concepts from `grok_x_bytedance_mol-syn.md`
*   **Collective Conscious Choice (CLKOS)**: Formalizing distributed agency across biological networks.
*   **Noosphere Interaction**: The "field" of knowledge that guides biological innovation.
*   **Entropic Regularization**: Biological structures minimize "Semantic Entropy," not just thermodynamic free energy.

## Project Structure (Proposed)

*   `ukft_bio/`: Core python package for biological simulation.
    *   `folding.py`: Discrete choice minimizer for protein folding (AlphaFold-inspired but Choice-driven).
    *   `synthesis.py`: Molecular synthesis pathways as linguistic derivations.
    *   `evolution.py`: Agent-based evolutionary simulator.
*   `experiments/`: Reproducible experiment scripts.
    *   **Exp 01-05**: Basic Entropic Folding.
    *   **Exp 06-10**: The "Molecular Prophet" (predicting novel structures).
    *   **Exp 11+**: CLKOS Emergence.
*   `data/`: PDB structure files, sequence data.
*   `references/`: Background reading (e.g., `grok_x_bytedance_mol-syn.md`).
*   `feedback/`: Agent collaboration logs.

## Quick Start

See [bootstrap_baton.md](bootstrap_baton.md) for instructions on initializing this repository's structure.

## Collaboration

As with `ukftphys`, we welcome **Carbon-based** and **Silicon-based** collaborators.
